# vscode-mock-debug

This is a VS Code extension based on `vscode-mock-debug`, an example project from Microsoft for developing a Debug Adapter.
The extension provides a rudimentary Debug Adapter that connects to a C-SPY instance via a CSpyRuby script,
thus enabling some very basic C-SPY debugging functionality in VS Code.
